# Decision-Tree-Classifier

A small machine learning project I put together using my PhD data using Python.

I have more than a dozen bodily measurements from about 150 male and 110 female mongooses from five locations around the
world. These five locations can be separated into two groups: the native range (India) and the introduced range 
(Jamaica, Hawaii, St. Croix, and Mauritius). I wanted to investigate if one or more traits could be used to determine the 
origin of an individual, so I set up a decision tree classifier for each sex. 

Understanding the differences between native and introduced (i.e., invasive) populations can lend insights into the
natural selection process while also shedding light on how and why some invasive species are more successful at invasion
than others and what the driving factors for their success are.
